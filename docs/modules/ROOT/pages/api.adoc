= API Reference

== Basic Options

Multiple settings of the `GSNProvider` can be set at creation:

```javascript
const options = { useGSN: true, fixedGasLimit: 10000 }; // Among others
new GSNProvider("http://localhost:8545", options);
```

These are documented below.

[[use-gsn]]
=== useGSN

```javascript
useGSN (bool)
```

Whether to send meta txs by default, or a function that receives a payload and returns whether to use a meta tx (defaults to true).

=== signKey

```javascript
signKey (hex string)
```

Optional private key to sign the meta txs, using the underlying provider `sign` if not set.

[[approve-function]]
=== approveFunction
```javascript
approveFunction (function)
```

Optional function for generating application approval data for a transaction, and returns a `bytes` approval data (such as a signature) that can be checked in the
recipient; receives as a parameter a single object with the properties `from`, `to`, `encodedFunctionCall`, `txFee`, `gasPrice`, `gas`, `nonce`, `relayerAddress`, `relayHubAddress`.
=== fixedGasPrice

```javascript
fixedGasPrice (integer|string)
```

Fixed gas price to use in all gsn transactions.

=== fixedGasLimit

```javascript
fixedGasLimit (integer|string)
```

Fixed gas limit to use in all gsn transactions.

=== minStake

```javascript
minStake (integer)
```

Filters out relays with stake below this value (optional)

=== minDelay

```javascript
minDelay (integer)
```

Filters out relays with unstake delay below this value (optional)

=== verbose

```javascript
verbose (bool)
```

== Advanced Options

These are related to the relayer selection algorithm: most likely you will not need to use them.

=== preferredRelayer

```javascript
preferredRelayer (object)
```

Attempt to use this relayer, falling back to the regular lookup algorithm on failure. Mandatory options are `RelayServerAddress`, `relayUrl` and `transactionFee`.

Sample configuration:

```javascript
preferredRelayer = {
  RelayServerAddress: '0x73a652f54d5fd8273f17a28e206d47f5bd1bc06a',
  relayUrl: 'http://localhost:8090',
  transactionFee: '70',
};
```

=== gasPriceFactorPercent

```javascript
`gasPriceFactorPercent (integer)
```

Percentage increase over the network gas price for gsn transactions (defaults to 20, note that you need to clear web3 default fixed gasprice for this setting to
go into effect).
=== httpTimeout

```javascript
httpTimeout (integer)
```

Timeout in ms for HTTP requests to relayers (defaults to 10000).

=== allowedRelayNonceGap

```javascript
allowedRelayNonceGap (integer)
```

(defaults to 3)

=== relayTimeoutGrace

```javascript
relayTimeoutGrace (integer)
```

Whenever a relayer timeouts a request, it is downscored by the client, and this penalization is reset every `relayTimeoutGrace` seconds (defaults to 1800, 30 mins)

=== calculateRelayScore

```javascript
`calculateRelayScore (function)
```

Given a relayer, must return a numeric score (the higher the better) to rank it (defaults to using the transaction fee and penalizations due to timeouts, maxes at
1000)

=== relayFilter

```javascript
relayFilter (function)
```

Given a relayer, must return a boolean indicating whether it is elligible (defaults to using `minDelay` and `minStake`)

[[tx-fee]]
=== txfee

```javascript
txfee (integer)
```

Forcefully use this transaction fee instead of the one advertised by the relayer (may lead to overpayment or rejections, defaults to empty)

=== addScoreRandomness

```javascript
addScoreRandomness (function)
```

Used for injecting randomness tie-breaking between relayers with the same score (defaults to uniform 0..1 random)


== Transaction Parameters

In addition to the regular transaction parameters (`from`, `gas`, etc), the GSN provider will also accept these parameters, which will override the ones set during provider creation.

[WARNING]
====
When using https://www.npmjs.com/package/@truffle/contract[Truffle contracts], you must also pass one of the regular parameters. Since GSN transactions by definition carry no Ether, `value` is a good choice for this:

```javascript
await myTruffleContract.myFunction(paramA, { useGSN: false, value: 0 });
```
====

=== useGSN

```javascript
useGSN (bool)
```

Same as the <<use-gsn, `useGSN`>> construction option.

=== txFee

```javascript
txFee (integer)
```

Same as the <<tx-fee, `txFee`>> construction option.

=== approveFunction

```javascript
approveFunction (function)
```

Same as the <<approve-function, `approveFunction`>> construction option.
